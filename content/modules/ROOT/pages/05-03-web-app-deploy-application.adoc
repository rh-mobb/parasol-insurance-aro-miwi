[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="attributes+"]
curl -O {azure_ai_info_url}
oc create secret generic dot-env --from-file .env

- Let's find the Route of the {argocd} instance by running the following command in the Terminal:
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, bash, subs="attributes+"]
echo "   {argocd} UI : https://$(oc get route argocd-server -ojsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}')/ "
